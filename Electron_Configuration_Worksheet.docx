----Answer Key (teacher use only)----
1. B — 1s2 2s2 2p4.
2. B — No two electrons in an atom can have the same set of four quantum numbers (equivalently: at most two electrons per orbital and they must have opposite spins).
3. B — One electron goes into each 2p orbital with parallel spins (↑ ↑ ↑).
4. C — "3s: ↑↑" violates Pauli because two electrons in the same orbital must have opposite spins (↑↓ is allowed, ↑↑ is not).
5. B — 3d is filled after 4s in the standard Aufbau order (4s → 3d → 4p).
6. B — 1s2 2s2 2p(↑, ↑, —) shows each 2p orbital singly occupied before pairing.
7. Example answer: "The Pauli Exclusion Principle says no two electrons in the same atom can have identical quantum numbers, so an orbital can hold at most two electrons and they must have opposite spins."
8. Orbital filling: 1s: ↑↓ 2s: ↑↓ 2p: ↑ ↑ ↑ (i.e., 2px ↑, 2py ↑, 2pz ↑). Hund’s Rule says put one electron in each degenerate orbital (the 2p orbitals) with parallel spins before you start pairing them.
9. Aufbau Principle — it states electrons occupy the lowest available energy orbitals first; 3s is lower in energy than 3p, so 3s fills before 3p.
10. Sulfur (3p4): The 3p subshell has three orbitals; with four electrons you place ↑ ↑ ↓ (or two orbitals singly occupied with ↑ and the third orbital has a pair ↑↓). That gives 2 unpaired electrons. Using Hund’s Rule, you first place one electron in each 3p orbital (↑ ↑ ↑), then add the fourth electron to pair up in one orbital (↑↓, ↑, ↑) → two unpaired.
